    <s id="1:1">PHILADELPHIA — Archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago.</s>
    <s id="1:2">The tomb, they say, is only the first discovered out of what could be more than a dozen.</s>
    <s id="1:3">All, they believe, are the final resting places of members of a forgotten dynasty.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="2">
    <s id="2:1">The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="3">
    <s id="3:1">The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty.</s>
    <s id="3:2">These are located at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="4">
    <s id="4:1">"It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty," said Wegner.</s>
    <s id="4:2">Necropolis — literally, "city of the dead" — is the term for an ancient cemetery or large complex of tombs.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="5">
    <s id="5:1">Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs because of an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, parts of which are damaged or missing.</s>
    <s id="5:2">After analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 of the unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty.</s>

    <s id="6:1">## "Forgotten To History"</s>
  </p>
  <p id="7">
    <s id="7:1">The name Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="8">
    <s id="8:1">"They basically were forgotten to history," Wegner said.</s>
    <s id="8:2">"In the later king lists, they don't appear.</s>
    <s id="8:3">They just kind of vanish."</s>
  </p>
  <p id="9">
    <s id="9:1">The tomb, dated to 1650 B.C., appears to have been raided by tomb robbers in ancient times, Wegner said.</s>
    <s id="9:2">Even the king's bodily remains were ripped apart.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="10">
    <s id="10:1">Work conducted on the skeleton suggests that Senebkay stood about 5 feet 10 inches tall and died in his mid- to late 40s.</s>

  <p id="11">
    <s id="11:1">## Reused Organ Chest</s>
  </p>
  <p id="12">
    <s id="12:1">The tomb contained remains of a funerary mask, a coffin and a cedar chest.</s>
    <s id="12:2">The chest would have been used to house the king's internal organs, customarily removed before burial.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="13">
    <s id="13:1">The chest apparently had been reused and seems to have been taken from the nearby tomb of an earlier king already known to history.</s>
    <s id="13:2">The discovery of that tomb, belonging to a king named Sobekhotep, was announced by the Penn-Egypt team this week.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="14">
    <s id="14:1">The string of discoveries began last year, when Wegner and his associates found a 60-ton stone sarcophagus chamber that appeared to have been moved from its original site.</s>
    <s id="14:2">They identified its original owner as Sobekhotep, but are still identifying the king for whom it was reused.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="15">
    <s id="15:1">The new discovery of the tomb of Woseribre Senebkay occurred in the process of excavating ruins near the 60-ton chamber.</s>
    <s id="15:2">The tombs of other apparent members of the dynasty are thought to lie nearby.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="16">
    <s id="16:1">Senebkay's tomb is painted with images of the goddesses Nut, Nephthys, Selket and Isis.</s>
    <s id="16:2">His reign occurred during what is known as the Second Intermediate Period, a time when multiple dynasties were competing for supremacy, Wegner said.</s>
